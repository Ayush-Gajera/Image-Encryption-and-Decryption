# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption-Using-AES-Algorithm
This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt image files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. It provides a secure way to transform an image into unreadable data and restore it back to its original form by decrypting it with the correct key.
