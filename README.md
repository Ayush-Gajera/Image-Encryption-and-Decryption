# 🛡️ Image Encryption and Decryption Using AES Algorithm
This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt image files. It provides a secure way to transform an image into unreadable data and restore it back to its original form by decrypting it with the correct key.
# 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt image files. It provides a secure way to transform an image into unreadable data and restore it back to its original form by decrypting it with the correct key.

The system uses Python and implements cryptographic techniques to ensure data confidentiality and integrity for image-based file handling.

# 🚀 Features

### ✅ Image Encryption: Encrypt image files securely.
### ✅ Image Decryption: Decrypt encrypted image files back to their original state.
### ✅ GUI Interface : A user-friendly interface for easier interaction (with HTML,CSS).
### ✅ File Selection Dialogs: Use dialog boxes for selecting image files to encrypt or decrypt.
### ✅ Secure Key Usage: Encrypt and decrypt images with a user-provided key for added security.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Python 3.x
### PyCrypto / Cryptography
### AES Encryption Algorithm
### Flask (HTML,CSS)
